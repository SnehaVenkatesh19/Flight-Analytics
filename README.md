LCC vs Non-LCC Delay Time
Airlines and passengers incur substantial financial losses annually due to flight delays, impacting expenses, productivity, and public perception. Our investigation aims to assess differences in delay durations between Low Cost Carrier (LCC) and non-LCC airlines, vital for predicting consumer choices and shaping airline operations.

Hypothesis & Outcomes
We hypothesized variations in delay times between LCCs and non-LCCs due to operational and cost differences. Our analysis explored multiple outcomes, considering factors such as reduced profit margins and operational efficiency.

Ideal Experiment
An ideal experiment would control aircraft models, flight timing, and passenger capacity to accurately gauge delay causes.

Dataset Overview
Our dataset covers flight-related data from January to August 2023, detailing delays, origins, destinations, and causes. It provides insights into flight disruptions and patterns across airlines.

Regression Analysis
We conducted logarithmic regression analysis, revealing slightly lower delay rates for LCC flights, significant with a low p-value. Specific variables like day of the week and airport size were also analyzed.

Business Recommendations
To enhance operational efficiency, airlines should allocate staff based on flight distance and day of the week. Consumers should consider LCCs for shorter flights and larger airports to minimize delay times.

Conclusion
Despite statistically significant differences, delay times between LCC and non-LCC airlines are insubstantial. Both types remain competitive, allowing consumers to choose based on other factors like price and amenities, without compromising reliability.
